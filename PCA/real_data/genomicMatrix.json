"description": "TCGA adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) gene expression by RNAseq.<br><br> The gene expression profile was measured experimentally using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing platform by the University of North Carolina TCGA genome characterization center. Level 3 interpreted level data was downloaded from TCGA data coordination center. This dataset shows the gene-level transcription estimates, as in RSEM normalized count, percentile ranked within each sample.  Genes are mapped onto the human genome coordinates using UCSC cgData HUGO probeMap. Reference to method description from University of North Carolina TCGA genome characterization center: <a href=\"https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/tumor/acc/cgcc/unc.edu/illuminahiseq_rnaseqv2/rnaseqv2/unc.edu_ACC.IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2.Level_3.1.0.0/DESCRIPTION.txt\" target=\"_blank\"><u>DCC description</u></a><br><br>In order to more easily view the differential expression between samples, we set the default view to center each gene or exon to zero by independently subtracting the mean of the genomic location on the fly. Users can view the original non-normalized values by uncheck the \"Normalize\" option. For more information on how to use the cancer browser, please refer to the help page.<br><br>",
